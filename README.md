# pomp is designed to be a plug-and-play tool to deal with state-space model. TMB is another method to analyze complicated systems (e.g., non-linear systems). In this project, I intend to compare those two methods through analyzing one classic TMB example ("thetalog"). The TMB code can be found in Kristensen et al. (2016), I rewrote the code to pomp. 
# After building pomp and TMB functions, I rewrote the likelihood function based on the output of the latent random variable and use optimum algorithm to find the MLE and the corresponding value of log likelihood. However, all those optimum algorithms have issues to find mle under the likelihood function I wrote.
# The reason why those algorithms don't work may come from the random effect (those algorithms are not really good at dealing with random effect). One exception is to directly use TMB under nlminb inference (the detailed likelihood function is generated directly by MakeADFun and directly assigned to nlminb).
